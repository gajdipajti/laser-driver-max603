# LM3914 values

I used a circuit tutorial from [Peter J. Vis](https://www.petervis.com/Education/lm3914/lm3914-circuit-tutorial.html).

## R1 value - how much current we want to give to the bar?

*I used skipped this question by using a 10k potentiometer on the Ref\_OUT pin (PIN7). This would result in 1,25 mA-25 mA range. But don't test the higher range.*

## R2 value - maximum input signal

*As I liked the 1.25V reference, I simply shorted the R1 and Ref\_ADJ pin (PIN8) to the ground.* [Calculator](https://www.petervis.com/Education/lm3914/lm3914-resistor-r2-calculator.html)

## Mode selection - bar or dot?

*5V on PIN 9 would set it to bar.*
